## Program Versions
* OS Version: Windows
* Python Version: 3.11.2
* Pygame Version: 2.1.3

## Motivation
The reason we chose to build this snake game is because the snake game is a classic that has been played for decades and it was something we were both familiar with. The game also gives us a good opportunity to learn the basics of game development. Finally, it gave us good practice with python and pygame as well as using the model-view-controller architecture pattern.

## Reasoning
The snake game was developed using object-oriented programming to organize the code into classes and functions. We organized the code using the model-view-controller pattern which separates the program into three components:

* Model: handles game logic and data structures
* View: handles graphics and UI
* Controller: handles input and updates model and view respectively

We decided to choose this approach because it allowed for a clear separation of concerns as well as making it easier to understand and modify the code. This way the code is more maintainable and easier to look at.

## Future Work
The snake game can be further enhanced by:
* Adding a timer 
* Adding levels and difficulty settings
* Adding sound effects or music
* Allowing customization settings for snake color, background, music, etc.
* Adding a high score system

## Generalization
The snake game can be applied and generalized to other types of games or applications because of the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern. The pattern allows us to separate the code into different components that handle the data, UI, and input. This way the code becomes more organized and maintainable for any type of game or software application.
